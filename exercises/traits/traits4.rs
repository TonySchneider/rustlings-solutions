// YOU MAY ONLY CHANGE THE NEXT LINE
// I am using "impl" because it requires that both arguments be of the same specific type that implements the Licensed trait.
// This is preferable over using `dyn`, which allows for dynamic typing. Dynamic typing is less suitable here since we need to ensure type consistency for comparison.
// Also, along with the dyn, the argument must to be passed as reference. and here in the code I can change only the following code line and the function calls are passing the value itself and not reference.
